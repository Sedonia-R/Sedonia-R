🔭 I’m currently working on 🌿 Plant Sitter Pro 🌿, an app that connects plant owners with people who have green thumbs. You can see this project here -> https://sample-service-name-f4fc.onrender.com

🔭 I've built a website for an IT Consulting Professional ([www.raethel.com](https://sedonia-r.github.io/raethstein-consulting/)).
